# GeoNode Proxies: Premium Residential & Datacenter Solutions, 80% Below Standard Rates, 10GB Trial for Only $5

So you're looking for a proxy service that won't drain your budget but still delivers solid performance? Let me tell you about GeoNode—a Singapore-based proxy provider that's been making waves since 2020. What caught my attention isn't just their pricing (though we'll get to that), it's how they've managed to build something genuinely useful for developers without all the usual corporate bloat.

## What Actually Is GeoNode?

GeoNode is basically your gateway to millions of IP addresses across 190+ countries. They're not reselling someone else's proxies—they own their infrastructure, which explains why they can offer rates that are 80% below what most competitors charge. Over 10,000 developers have already jumped on board, and honestly? I get why.

The company was founded by Adir Semana, and they've carved out a niche by focusing on what matters: residential and datacenter proxies that just work. No ISP proxies, no mobile proxies—they've kept it simple and done it well.

## The Good Stuff: What Makes GeoNode Worth Your Time

### Lightning-Fast Performance

GeoNode claims an average response time of 500ms with a 99% success rate. Now, I've seen enough proxy services to know those numbers sound almost too good, but user reviews back this up for the most part. They're not going to win any speed awards against premium services like Bright Data, but for market research, SEO monitoring, or price comparison scraping? They're solid.

### Coverage That Actually Matters

With millions of unique IPs spread across 190+ countries, you've got options. Country-level targeting is standard, and premium users get city-level and ISP-level targeting. Whether you need to scrape data from Japan, Brazil, or somewhere in between, they've got you covered.

### Developer-Friendly Setup

Here's where GeoNode really shines—their API is actually intuitive. They support HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS5 protocols, and the documentation doesn't feel like it was written by robots. You can set up rotating proxies or sticky sessions (keeping the same IP for 5, 10, 15, 30, or 60 minutes), and integration with Python, Node.js, PHP, Ruby, and other languages is straightforward.

### Ethical IP Sourcing

They're GDPR compliant and claim all their residential IPs are ethically sourced through consent-based partnerships. In an industry where this stuff matters, it's good to see someone taking it seriously.

## The Pricing Breakdown: Where GeoNode Gets Interesting

Let's talk money. GeoNode's pricing is refreshingly simple—no hidden fees, no surprise charges, just straightforward plans.

| Plan | Data Included | Price per GB | Monthly Cost | Best For |
|------|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Trial** | 10 GB | $0.50 | $5 | Testing the service |
| **Starter** | 50 GB | $1.00 | $50 | Small projects & personal use |
| **Growth** | 267 GB | $0.75 | $200 | Growing businesses |
| **Business** | 1,000 GB | $0.50 | $500 | Enterprise-level operations |
| **Additional Data** | Pay-as-you-go | $0.50 - $1.00 | Varies | When you exceed your plan |

Here's the kicker: any unused bandwidth rolls over to the next month as long as your subscription is active. That's actually huge because most competitors make your data expire.

## Current Promotions & Discount Codes (2026)

I've dug around for the latest deals, and here's what's actually working:

- **5% Off Site-Wide**: Some coupon sites are listing a 5% discount code for GeoNode
- **$5 Trial Offer**: 10GB for $5 (3-day trial) - this is the best way to test the service
- **1,000 GB Free Trial**: Available for qualified enterprise users

Pro tip: GeoNode rarely offers promotional codes, so your best bet is to start with the $5 trial and scale up from there. The pricing is already competitive enough that you're not missing much without a coupon.

## Features That Actually Matter

**Unlimited Concurrent Connections**: No artificial limits on how many requests you can fire off simultaneously.

**Sticky Sessions**: Keep the same IP address for up to 60 minutes—perfect when you need consistent sessions.

**Geo-Targeting**: Target specific countries, cities, or even ISPs (on premium plans).

**Data Rollover**: Unused bandwidth carries forward. Seriously underrated feature.

**IP Rotation**: Automatic rotation at intervals you set, or on every request.

**Authentication Options**: Username/password or IP whitelisting (up to 20 IPs).

## The Real Talk: What Users Are Saying

GeoNode has a 4.7-star rating on Trustpilot, which is genuinely impressive for a proxy service. Here's what I've gathered from actual users:

**The Praise:**
- "Price per GB is the cheapest I've found"
- "Customer support is responsive and helpful"
- "Large IP pool with consistent performance"
- "Data rollover feature is a game-changer"

**The Complaints:**
- Some Reddit users report higher latency than advertised (up to 800ms in extreme cases)
- Performance can be inconsistent for time-sensitive tasks
- No mobile or ISP proxies if that's what you need
- Refund policy is unclear

The consensus? GeoNode is excellent for web scraping, market research, and SEO monitoring where speed isn't the absolute top priority. If you're doing real-time gaming or high-frequency trading, look elsewhere.

## Use Cases: Where GeoNode Excels

### Web Scraping
This is GeoNode's bread and butter. The rotating residential proxies handle most websites without triggering blocks, and the pricing makes large-scale scraping projects actually affordable.

### Price Comparison & Market Research
Need to check competitor pricing across different regions? GeoNode's geo-targeting makes this straightforward.

### SEO Monitoring
Track search rankings from different locations without breaking the bank.

### Social Media Management
Managing multiple accounts? The sticky sessions and residential IPs help you avoid detection.

### Ad Verification
Verify your ads are displaying correctly in different regions.

## How GeoNode Stacks Up Against Competitors

Let's be real for a second—GeoNode isn't the premium option. But it's also not trying to be.

**vs. Bright Data**: Bright Data has 72 million IPs and mobile proxies, but you'll pay 5-10x more per GB.

**vs. SOAX**: SOAX charges $2.20 per GB versus GeoNode's $0.50-$1.00. Similar features, but GeoNode wins on price.

**vs. Oxylabs**: Oxylabs is the premium choice with better support and more proxy types, but again, you're paying premium prices.

GeoNode's sweet spot is the middle ground: better than the budget options, cheaper than the premium ones, with features that matter for most use cases.

## Setting Up GeoNode: The Quick Version

1. 👉 [Sign up for the $5 trial](https://geonode.com)
2. Choose your proxy type (residential or datacenter)
3. Configure your targeting (country, city, or ISP)
4. Grab your credentials from the dashboard
5. Integrate using their API or browser extension

The whole process takes about 5 minutes. Their documentation has code examples in every major language, so you're not figuring this out from scratch.

## The Bottom Line

GeoNode isn't perfect, but it's a solid choice if you need reliable proxies without spending a fortune. The $5 trial is genuinely risk-free, the pricing is transparent, and the service does what it promises for most use cases.

Is it the fastest? No. The most feature-rich? Also no. But for developers and businesses who need good-enough proxies at great prices, GeoNode hits the mark. The data rollover feature alone makes it worth considering, and the 80% price difference compared to standard rates isn't marketing fluff—it's real.

**Quick Recommendation**: Start with the trial, test it with your specific use case, and scale up to the Starter or Growth plan if it works. Don't overthink it—at $5, the trial is cheaper than a coffee, and you'll know within a day whether it fits your needs.
